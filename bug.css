The CSS specificity rules can lead to unexpected styling issues when selectors have equal specificity. For instance, consider two rules with identical specificity targeting the same element:

```css
#myElement {
  color: blue;
}

.myElement {
  color: red;
}
```

If an element has both `id="myElement"` and `class="myElement"`, the resulting color might be unpredictable as both rules have equal specificity. The order in which these rules are defined within the stylesheet can influence which rule takes precedence, leading to unexpected behavior that's hard to debug if not noticed carefully.
