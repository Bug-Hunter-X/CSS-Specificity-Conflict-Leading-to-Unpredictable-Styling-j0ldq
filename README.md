This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, CSS bug related to specificity conflicts. Two CSS rules target the same element with equal specificity, making the resulting style dependent on the order of rules in the stylesheet. This can lead to unexpected behavior and difficulty in debugging. The solution shows how to resolve the issue using more specific selectors or using the `!important` flag (though generally discouraged for its negative impact on maintainability).
