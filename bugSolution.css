Several approaches can resolve this issue: 

1. **Increase Specificity:**  Modify the selectors to increase the specificity of one rule. For example:

```css
#myElement.myElement {
  color: blue; /* More specific */
}

.myElement {
  color: red;
}
```

2. **Use `!important` (Use with caution):** 

```css
#myElement {
  color: blue !important; 
}

.myElement {
  color: red;
}
```

Note: While using `!important` solves the immediate problem, it can negatively affect maintainability and make debugging more difficult in the long run. It's generally recommended to address specificity issues by enhancing the selectors themselves rather than relying on `!important`.
